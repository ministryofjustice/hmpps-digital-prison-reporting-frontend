Use this component when want to to save screen space and have data/functionality initially hidden from view until the user interacts with the accordion button.

## Notes

Accordion content is added as HTML. Users can also add extra data/functionality in the accordions header. This should provided as html.

The accordion component uses the [gov.uk details component](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/details/) under the hood.
