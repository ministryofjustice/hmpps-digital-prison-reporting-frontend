Use this component when users need to navigate to a small number of child pages. Such specific project-level applications within a larger program, or when choosing areas specific to user type (e.g. Customer or Seller).

{% header 2, "When not to use" %}

Do not use this component when users need to navigate to a large number of child pages, as it may be an inefficient use of screen space.

Additionally, if users will need to navigate horizontally between child pages, look at alternatives such as the [MoJ side navigation](https://design-patterns.service.justice.gov.uk/components/side-navigation/).
