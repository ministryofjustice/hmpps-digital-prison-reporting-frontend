Components in this section have been created by the Digital Prison Reporting team.

To use these components you can either:

- copy the HTML code
- copy the Nunjucks code (if you are using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) or the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs))

You can give feedback starting a [discussion](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-digital-prison-reporting-frontend/discussions/new) on GitHub.
