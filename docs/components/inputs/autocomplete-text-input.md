## Overview

### When to use

Use this component when users need to choose from a large set of options. Either populated statically, or dynamically from a remote API endpoint.

Example uses:
- Choosing an establishment name.
- Searching for a post code.
- Searching for a person's name.

### When not to use

Do not use this component for a small set of options, or where discovery of the available options is important. In these cases a Radio input of similar may be a better option.
