## 🚧 Docs in progress 🚧 

The `line` chart visualisation type represents data as a line chart visualisation.

Charts are accompanied by a table/list representation of the underlying chart data. 

## When to use

Use this visualisation type when you need to display data in as a line chart. 

## Definition

```js
{
  id: 'line-definition-example',
  type: 'line',
  display: 'line title',
  description: 'line visualisation description',
  column: {
    ...
  }
}
```

See the [Targeting data](/dashboards/visualisations/targeting-data) for and how to target data with the `column`
