A `scorecard-group` is made of one or many `scorecards`. see [here](/dashboards/visualisations/scorecard)

## When to use

Use this visualisation type when you need to display data as a group of scorecards.

  type: 'scorecard-group',
  display: 'Scorecard group title',
  description: 'Scorecard group visualisation description',
  columns: {
    ...
  }
}
```
